### Abstract

# Project Name: Rollins Club Connector

## Purpose

The Rollins Club Connector aims to simplify the process of finding and joining student clubs and organizations at Rollins College. By creating a user-friendly database and interface, this project seeks to enhance student engagement and participation in extracurricular activities by making it easier for students to discover clubs that match their interests. This initiative will also serve as a platform for clubs to increase their visibility, recruit new members, and share events and updates with the campus community. We hope this will make the whole Rollins community more interconnected.

## Target Users

- **Students** looking for clubs to join based on their interests, availability, or major.
- **Club Leaders** seeking to promote their organization, recruit members, and advertise events.
- **College Administrators** who wish to oversee student engagement activities and ensure a vibrant campus community.
