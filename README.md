### Abstract

**Project Name:** Rollins Resource Hub

**Purpose:** The Rollins Resource Hub is designed to enhance the educational and social experience at Rollins College by providing a centralized database where students, faculty, and staff can easily access and share essential resources. The project aims to foster a more connected and informed campus community by streamlining the access to academic materials, extracurricular opportunities, and campus-wide events.

**Target Users:** The primary audience for the Rollins Resource Hub includes Rollins College students seeking academic resources, extracurricular activities, and community engagement opportunities; faculty members aiming to disseminate course-related content and research; and staff requiring efficient access to operational and administrative information.

**Data to Use:** The database will incorporate comprehensive data such as academic course listings, faculty directories, student organization details, event schedules, and administrative policies. Data sources will include official Rollins College records, departmental contributions, and direct inputs from student organizations. The platform will also feature user-generated content, such as course reviews and club ratings, to provide valuable insights and feedback to the college community.
